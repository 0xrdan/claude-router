# Knowledge Base - Gitignored by Default
#
# The knowledge directory contains project-specific insights learned
# during Claude Code sessions. By default, this is local/personal.
#
# To share knowledge with your team:
# 1. Remove the entries you want to share from this .gitignore
# 2. Or delete this .gitignore entirely to share everything
#
# Files:
# - cache/          Classification cache (performance, not shareable)
# - learnings/      Patterns, quirks, decisions (shareable if desired)
# - context/        Session state (ephemeral, not shareable)
# - state.json      Learning mode state (local only)

# Cache - always local (performance optimization)

# Session context - always local (ephemeral)
