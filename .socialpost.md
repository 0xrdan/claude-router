**Claude Router v1.4.0 - Now with Persistent Memory**

Just shipped a feature I've been wanting for a while: **Claude Code that actually remembers what it learns about your project.**

**The problem:** Every Claude session starts fresh. You discover a quirk in your auth system, debug it for 30 minutes, session ends... next day you're back to square one. Repeat forever.

**The manual workaround:** You could update CLAUDE.md with project notes, but:
- You have to remember to do it
- You have to manually extract insights from conversations
- Context often gets lost before you think to save it
- One file gets cluttered fast

**The solution:** A knowledge system that captures and persists project insights automatically:

```
/learn     - Extract insights from current conversation
/learn-on  - Enable continuous learning
/knowledge - See what's been learned
```

| Manual CLAUDE.md | Knowledge System |
|------------------|------------------|
| Remember to update | Automatic on `/learn` |
| Extract insights yourself | Claude analyzes for you |
| Context lost before you save | Continuous mode captures as you go |
| Single cluttered file | Organized by type (patterns/quirks/decisions) |

It captures:
- **Patterns** - "Error handling here uses custom logger"
- **Quirks** - "Auth returns 200 even on errors, check response.success"
- **Decisions** - "Chose Redis over in-memory because..."

**Why it's part of Claude Router (not standalone):**

A standalone memory just stores text. Integrated with routing, the system *acts* on what it learns - knowledge informs which model handles your query.

It's the difference between a notebook and a brain.

**Try it:**
```
/plugin marketplace add 0xrdan/claude-router
/plugin install claude-router@claude-router-marketplace
```
